Binary Trees
This repository contains solutions to various tasks related to binary trees. The tasks include creating binary tree nodes, inserting nodes as left or right children, traversing the tree in different orders, and measuring the height and depth of the tree nodes.

Files
Each task is implemented in a separate C file and is thoroughly documented. Here's a brief overview of the files:

0-binary_tree_node.c: Creates a binary tree node.
1-binary_tree_insert_left.c: Inserts a node as the left-child of another node.
2-binary_tree_insert_right.c: Inserts a node as the right-child of another node.
3-binary_tree_delete.c: Deletes an entire binary tree.
4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c: Checks if a node is a leaf.
5-binary_tree_is_root.c: Checks if a node is a root.
6-binary_tree_preorder.c: Traverses a binary tree using pre-order traversal.
7-binary_tree_inorder.c: Traverses a binary tree using in-order traversal.
8-binary_tree_postorder.c: Traverses a binary tree using post-order traversal.
9-binary_tree_height.c: Measures the height of a binary tree.
10-binary_tree_depth.c: Measures the depth of a node in a binary tree.
Compilation
All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.

Usage
Each file includes a main function demonstrating the functionality of the implemented task. To compile and test a specific task, use the provided compilation command in the task's description and execute the generated executable.
